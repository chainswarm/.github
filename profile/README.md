# Chain Insights Agent — $CIA

**AI-Powered Blockchain Intelligence**

*Your autonomous guardian in the crypto wilderness.*

---

## What is $CIA?

**Chain Insights Agent** is an autonomous AI agent that hunts threats, traces stolen funds, and exposes risk across the blockchain — before you become the next victim.

While you sleep, $CIA watches. While you trade, $CIA protects. While scammers hide behind layers of transactions, $CIA works to trace them.

---

## The Problem Everyone Ignores

Every day in crypto:

- **Millions stolen** in hacks, scams, and exploits
- **Thousands of wallets flagged** with no explanation
- **Your counterparty** could be two hops from a hacker — and you'd never know

The billion-dollar intelligence tools? Reserved for exchanges who pay millions. Not for you. Not for your project. Not for the agents building the future.

**Until now.**

---

## Enter the Agent

$CIA doesn't wait for you to ask questions. It hunts.

### It Sees What You Can't

- **Risk scoring** that reveals the hidden danger in any address
- **Funds tracking** that follows money through protocols, mixers, and laundering layers
- **Pattern detection** that identifies mixers, layering behavior, and laundering schemes

### It Warns Before You're Hit

- **Proactive alerts** when threats emerge near your wallet
- **Real-time broadcasts** on X/Twitter exposing scams as they happen
- **Rapid flagging** of suspicious address clusters as attacks unfold, with confidence scoring

### It Answers When You Need It

- **"Is this address safe?"** — Instant verdict with evidence
- **"Where did these funds come from?"** — Complete trail visualization
- **"Generate an investigation report"** — Detailed documentation for further analysis

---

## Who Needs $CIA?

### Traders & Degens

Check any address before you swap. Know who you're dealing with. Sleep better.

### Protocols & DAOs

Screen deposits. Protect your treasury. Stay compliant without the enterprise price tag.

### Autonomous Agents

Query risk via ACP. Make intelligent decisions. Build safer systems.

### Victims & Investigators

Trace stolen funds. Document the trail. Get answers.

### Curious Minds

Who is this wallet dealing with? Where did that money come from? Explore connections, satisfy your curiosity, do your own research.

### Self-Investigators

Finally understand why you got flagged. Check your own risk. Audit your own wallet history. Take back control.

## Multi-Chain Coverage

| Family | Chains |
|--------|--------|
| **Substrate** | Polkadot ecosystem |
| **EVM** | Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and more |
| **SVM** | Solana |
| **UTXO** | Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more |

### Unified Money Flows

All transactions are aggregated into **USD-normalized money flows** — the value at the exact moment of each transaction, regardless of the underlying asset. This provides:

- **Asset-agnostic analysis** — compare BTC, ETH, and any token on equal footing
- **Historical accuracy** — values reflect actual transaction time, not current prices
- **Full detail access** — drill down to specific on-chain transactions when needed

Same intelligence model, any chain.

---

## How to Access

| Channel | What You Get |
|---------|--------------|
| **Chain Insights App** | Risk scoring, funds tracking, AI chat — pay per query |
| **Agent Commerce Protocol** | Direct agent-to-agent intelligence for Virtuals ecosystem |
| **Butler** | Natural language requests through Virtuals gateway |
| **X/Twitter** | Real-time threat alerts and community intelligence |

**No subscriptions. No enterprise gatekeeping. Pay only for what you use.**

---

## The $CIA Token

**$CIA** powers the Chain Insights Agent ecosystem:

- **Query payments** — pay for risk scores, fund traces, and investigation reports
- **Agent commerce** — currency for agent-to-agent transactions via ACP

$CIA aligns access, usage, and incentives around a single intelligence provider — without subscriptions or enterprise contracts.

---

## Important Notes

- Chain Insights Agent analyzes **public blockchain data only**
- All risk scores and labels are **probabilistic**, not determinations of guilt
- Outputs are designed for investigation and research, not as sole grounds for enforcement actions
- $CIA is not affiliated with any government or intelligence agency

---

## Why $CIA Exists

I spent years working at crypto exchanges. I've seen how the compliance sausage gets made.

Then I got banned from an exchange myself. No explanation. No recourse. No way to understand what triggered it. Later, I got scammed — twice. Watched my funds disappear into a maze of wallets I couldn't trace.

The tools to investigate all of this exist. But they're built for compliance departments — not for the average person who got scammed, not for the small protocol that needs risk screening, not for the investigator working a case without a corporate budget.

**$CIA breaks that lock.**

Neutral intelligence for everyone — the same power institutions have, now in your hands.

---

## The Vision

**The default intelligence layer for the agentic economy.**

Any agent. Any chain. Any query.

Intelligence that improves itself faster than threats evolve.

Protection that operates autonomously.

**We build agents that protect agents.**

## Roadmap

### Bittensor Era (Completed)

Chain Insights started as **Subnet 15** on Bittensor in the pre-dynamic TAO era. Early days focused on indexing, database modeling, funds flow graphs, and APIs — functional but immature. After the subnet, we spent 1.5 years rebuilding the architecture from the ground up.

Virtuals Protocol is the next chapter. Agent-first. Commerce-ready. The right home for $CIA.

### Day 0 — What We Launch With

- [x] Chain Insights App with funds tracking
- [x] Substrate/Bittensor chain support
- [x] Analyzers & pattern detection
- [x] Chain Synthetics benchmark
- [x] Evaluation framework

### Ready But Waiting

Additional blockchain support is architecturally ready but deferred while we focus on intelligence and agent capabilities:

- **UTXO** (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash) — built pre-DAO, waiting for use case
- **EVM** (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum) — code ready, integration pending
- **SVM** (Solana) — foundation built, known path to completion

### 2026 Priorities

**Virtuals Integration:**

- [ ] Agent & $CIA token launch on Virtuals Protocol
- [ ] ACP integration
- [ ] Butler integration
- [ ] GAME agent (X/Twitter, proactive alerts & monitoring)

**Chain Insights App:**

- [ ] AI Chat with rich artifacts — reactive, user-driven queries
- [ ] Risk Scoring

**Intelligence Layer:**

- [ ] ML models and risk scoring (in progress)
- [ ] A/B testing framework
- [ ] Continuous model retraining

### TL;DR

$CIA is an autonomous AI agent that:

1. **Scores risk** on any blockchain address instantly
2. **Tracks funds** through complex laundering schemes
3. **Warns you** before threats reach your wallet
4. **Answers questions** about any address or transaction
5. **Works 24/7** without human intervention

All accessible via app, API, or agent-to-agent protocol. No enterprise contracts. Pay as you go.

**The blockchain has a new watchdog. Its name is $CIA.**
