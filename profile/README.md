## Executive Summary

Chain Insights Subnet is a decentralised blockchain intelligence network built on Bittensor that provides real-time risk scoring, fraud detection, and investigative AI capabilities. Unlike centralised solutions that charge enterprises $50,000+ annually and offer no access to developers or retail users, Chain Insights delivers intelligence through three channels: a consumer application, an enterprise API, and an x402-enabled gateway for autonomous AI agents.

The subnet operates on a novel principle: **computation is cheap, innovation is priceless**. Rather than rewarding miners for running infrastructure, Chain Insights rewards researchers, data scientists, and AI engineers for improving algorithms, training superior models, and discovering validated intelligence. The subnet owner operates core infrastructure to ensure reliability, while miners compete in tournaments to advance the state of the art.

This architecture positions Chain Insights as the default intelligence layer for the emerging agentic economy—where autonomous systems require real-time, programmatic access to blockchain risk assessment before executing transactions.

## The Problem

### Centralised Intelligence is Broken

The blockchain intelligence market is dominated by a handful of centralised providers—Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs—who serve enterprise clients at premium prices. This model creates three critical gaps:

**1. Accessibility Gap**
Retail users have no visibility into their own risk profiles. An individual can be banned from an exchange with no explanation and no recourse to understand why their address was flagged.

**2. Developer Gap**
The agentic economy is emerging rapidly. Autonomous AI agents, DeFi protocols, and smart wallets need programmatic access to risk intelligence. Current providers offer no API access suitable for real-time, pay-per-query autonomous systems.

**3. Innovation Gap**
Closed systems innovate on their own timelines. Algorithm improvements, new pattern detection, and model updates happen behind proprietary walls. The broader ecosystem cannot contribute to or benefit from these advances.

### The Regulatory Imperative

Global regulation is accelerating. The EU's MiCA framework, US FinCEN Travel Rule, and expanding KYC requirements worldwide mean that every exchange, wallet, and DeFi protocol will require compliance tooling. The market for blockchain intelligence is not shrinking—it is about to expand dramatically.

---

## The Solution

### Neutral Intelligence Layer

Chain Insights Subnet provides a **neutral intelligence layer** for any blockchain. We do not decide who is good or bad—we provide the intelligence. Users, applications, and agents choose how to act on that intelligence.

This neutrality serves multiple use cases:

- **Compliance teams** identify high-risk counterparties
- **Investigators** trace stolen funds through complex laundering chains
- **Privacy advocates** audit their own transaction graph exposure
- **DeFi protocols** screen addresses before allowing interactions
- **AI agents** assess risk before executing autonomous transactions

### Three Access Channels

**Chain Insights Application**
A consumer-facing web application where users can:

- Check risk scores for any address (1 credit per query)
- Understand why addresses are flagged with explainable factors
- Chat with an AI investigator for complex queries
- Generate investigation reports

Pricing: 1,000 credits for 10 USDT. Free for the Bittensor community during beta.

**Enterprise API**
Direct API integration for exchanges, wallets, and compliance platforms requiring bulk queries, custom analytics, and SLA guarantees.

**x402 Agent Gateway**
An AI-native payment interface that enables autonomous agents to query risk intelligence in real time. No accounts, no subscriptions—just pay-per-query micropayments. A DeFi protocol can check counterparty risk before executing a swap. A wallet can warn users about suspicious recipients. A trading bot can avoid tainted addresses.

## Architecture

### Design Philosophy

> *"We don't need miners for mere execution. We need miners for breakthroughs."*

Chain Insights separates infrastructure from innovation:

- **Subnet Owner** operates core indexing infrastructure, ensuring a reliable "source of truth" across supported blockchains
- **Miners** compete to provide intelligence improvements—better algorithms, superior models, validated labels

This separation allows miners to focus entirely on advancing capabilities rather than maintaining servers. It also ensures production stability while enabling rapid innovation.

### Core Indexing Service

The foundation layer provides:

- **Unified Data Model:** All assets converted to USD value, enabling cross-chain analysis without currency-specific complexity
- **Aggregated Money Flows:** Focus on value relationships between addresses rather than individual transactions—smaller, faster, more analytical
- **Rich Feature Sets:** Pre-calculated ML features per address, volume time series, transaction graph metrics
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Blueprints ready for Substrate, EVM, and UTXO chains

This model is fundamentally different from traditional blockchain indexing. By aggregating flows and focusing on USD value, the dataset is compressed, queries are faster, and analysis centres on what matters: money movement patterns.

### Four Mechanisms of Intelligence

**Analytics Mechanism**
Miners submit optimised code for graph algorithms and pattern detection. Submissions are benchmarked against Chain Synthetics test data. Winners see their code deployed to production.

*Participants: Software engineers, algorithm researchers*
*Output: Fraud detection for mixers, layering networks, peel chains, and many more...*

**Labelling Mechanism**
Miners discover and verify address labels from public sources—exchange wallets, sanctioned addresses, known scams, hack-related addresses. Each label requires cryptographic evidence verified against the indexing service.

*Participants: OSINT specialists, data hunters*
*Output: Comprehensive address intelligence database*

**Machine Learning Mechanism**
Miners train risk scoring models using features from the indexing service and labels from the labelling mechanism. Models are evaluated against ground truth data and validated over time for real-world accuracy.

*Participants: Data scientists, ML engineers*
*Output: Real-time risk scores for any address*

**Intelligence Mechanism**
Miners fine-tune large language models for AML, blockchain forensics, and investigative queries. Models power the Chain Insights AI chat interface.

*Participants: AI engineers, LLM specialists*
*Output: Natural language investigation capabilities*

### Chain Synthetics: Objective Benchmarking

A critical challenge in fraud detection is measuring accuracy—there is no public "ground truth" dataset of labelled fraudulent activity. Chain Synthetics solves this by:

- **Injecting synthetic patterns** into real blockchain data (known mixers, layering topologies, and many more...)
- **Blending naturally:** Synthetic patterns are blurred and merged with existing transactions so they appear natural within the transaction graph—this directly impacts algorithm design quality
- **Replaying historical hacks** (recreating famous exploits within test environments)
- **Providing objective metrics** (precision, recall, speed—no subjective judging)

This enables tournament-based competition where the best submissions win based on measurable outcomes.

### Tournament-Based Emissions

Unlike some subnets that reward continuous infrastructure provision, Chain Insights uses tournament-based emissions:

- A miner who improves pattern detection by 5% earns emissions for that innovation
- Once the improvement is absorbed into the baseline, emissions stop
- Miners must innovate again to earn again

This model aligns incentives with progress. Stagnation is not rewarded. Breakthroughs are.
