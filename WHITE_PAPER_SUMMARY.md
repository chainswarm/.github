# Chain Insights Agent — White Paper Summary

**Autonomous Blockchain Intelligence for the Agentic Economy**

*Built on Virtuals Protocol | Token: $CIA*

---

## The Problem

Blockchain intelligence is broken:

- **Enterprises** pay millions for Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs
- **You** get banned from exchanges with zero explanation
- **AI agents** have no way to check if a counterparty is safe
- **Threats evolve daily** — static systems can't keep up

The tools exist. They're just not for you.

---

## The Agent

**Chain Insights Agent** is an autonomous AI that provides real-time risk intelligence for anyone — users, protocols, and other AI agents.

### Two Modes

| Reactive | Proactive |
|----------|-----------|
| You ask, it answers | It hunts without being asked |
| "Is this address safe?" | Warns before threats hit you |
| "Trace these stolen funds" | Auto-labels malicious addresses |
| Investigation reports | Broadcasts alerts on X/Twitter |

### Four Access Points

| Channel | For |
|---------|-----|
| **Chain Insights App** | Users — risk scores, fund tracking, AI chat |
| **ACP Gateway** | Agents — pay-per-query via Virtuals Protocol |
| **Butler** | Discovery — natural language requests |
| **X/Twitter** | Everyone — real-time threat alerts |

---

## What It Sees

### 100+ ML Features
Across 9 categories: volume, flow patterns, graph centrality, temporal behavior, risk proximity.

### 7 Pattern Detectors
Cycles, layering, network coordination, proximity risk, fraud motifs, burst activity, structuring.

### Multi-Chain Coverage
Substrate | EVM | SVM (Solana) | UTXO (Bitcoin)

All normalized to USD value flows. Same model, any chain.

---

## Self-Improving Intelligence

Most systems update quarterly. Chain Insights improves continuously.

**Chain Synthetics** — our benchmarking framework:
1. Inject synthetic fraud patterns into real blockchain data
2. Replay historical hacks (Mt. Gox, Ronin, FTX)
3. Test detection algorithms objectively
4. Auto-deploy improvements that beat current performance

> *The best intelligence system improves faster than threats evolve.*

---

## Who Uses It

| User | Problem | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Traders** | Unknown counterparty risk | Instant address risk checks |
| **DeFi Protocols** | Stolen funds in deposits | ACP-integrated screening |
| **Blocked Users** | "Why was I flagged?" | Explainable risk factors |
| **Investigators** | Tracing stolen funds | Visual flow tracking + reports |
| **AI Agents** | Need risk data to operate safely | Pay-per-query via ACP |

---

## Token: $CIA

### Utility
- Pay for queries, tracking, investigations
- Agent-to-agent payments via ACP
- Premium features and higher limits

### Pricing
- **Free credits** to start
- **Pay-as-you-go** after that
- **x402 on-chain payments** for seamless crypto micropayments
- No subscriptions. No enterprise gates.

### Burns
After covering development and infrastructure costs:

```
Net Earnings
    ├── 80% → Operations & Growth
    └── 20% → $CIA Burns
```

Burns activate only after sustainable profitability.

## Virtuals Protocol Integration

**Why Virtuals?**
- Agent-native platform built for autonomous AI
- ACP for standardized agent-to-agent commerce
- Butler for user discovery
- Ecosystem synergies with trading agents, DeFi agents, investigation agents

**ACP Services:**
- Risk Score
- Funds Tracking
- Investigation
- Address Labels
- Batch Screening
- Monitoring Alerts

---

## Roadmap
