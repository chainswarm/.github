# Chain Insights Agent — $CIA

**The AI That Sees Through the Blockchain**

*Your autonomous guardian in the crypto wilderness.*

---

## What is $CIA?

**Chain Insights Agent** is an autonomous AI agent that hunts threats, traces stolen funds, and exposes risk across the blockchain — before you become the next victim.

While you sleep, $CIA watches. While you trade, $CIA protects. While scammers hide behind layers of transactions, $CIA sees everything.

---

## The Problem Everyone Ignores

Every day in crypto:
- **Millions stolen** in hacks, scams, and exploits
- **Thousands of wallets flagged** with no explanation
- **Your counterparty** could be two hops from a hacker — and you'd never know

The billion-dollar intelligence tools? Reserved for exchanges who pay millions. Not for you. Not for your project. Not for the agents building the future.

**Until now.**

---

## Enter the Agent

$CIA doesn't wait for you to ask questions. It hunts.

### It Sees What You Can't
- **Risk scoring** that reveals the hidden danger in any address
- **Funds tracking** that follows money through the darkest corners of DeFi
- **Pattern detection** that catches mixers, layering, and laundering schemes

### It Warns Before You're Hit
- **Proactive alerts** when threats emerge near your wallet
- **Real-time broadcasts** on X/Twitter exposing scams as they happen
- **Auto-labeling** of malicious addresses the moment attacks begin

### It Answers When You Need It
- **"Is this address safe?"** — Instant verdict with evidence
- **"Where did these funds come from?"** — Complete trail visualization
- **"Generate an investigation report"** — Court-ready documentation

---

## Who Needs $CIA?

### Traders & Degens
Check any address before you swap. Know who you're dealing with. Sleep better.

### Protocols & DAOs
Screen deposits. Protect your treasury. Stay compliant without the enterprise price tag.

### Autonomous Agents
Query risk via ACP. Make intelligent decisions. Build safer systems.

### Victims & Investigators
Trace stolen funds. Document the trail. Get answers.

### Everyone Else
Finally understand why you got flagged. Check your own risk. Take back control.

## Multi-Chain Coverage

| Family | Chains |
|--------|--------|
| **Substrate** | Polkadot ecosystem |
| **EVM** | Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and more |
| **SVM** | Solana |
| **UTXO** | Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more |

All normalized to USD value flows. Same intelligence model, any chain.

---

## How to Access

| Channel | What You Get |
|---------|--------------|
| **Chain Insights App** | Risk scoring, funds tracking, AI chat — pay per query |
| **Agent Commerce Protocol** | Direct agent-to-agent intelligence for Virtuals ecosystem |
| **Butler** | Natural language requests through Virtuals gateway |
| **X/Twitter** | Real-time threat alerts and community intelligence |

**No subscriptions. No enterprise gatekeeping. Pay only for what you use.**

---

## The $CIA Token

**$CIA** is the settlement and value token for the intelligence ecosystem:

- **Medium of exchange** — pay for risk scores, fund traces, investigation reports via ACP
- **Agent-to-agent commerce** — native currency for autonomous workflows
- **Deflationary mechanism** — revenue-backed burnback aligned with protocol growth

### Ecosystem Commitment: Burnback at Scale

**Above $40M FDV** — burnback is active:

- **20% of monthly net revenue** is automatically directed to $CIA market buys
- **Buys are burned onchain** with transparent, published accounting
- **Net revenue** = total ACP payments minus operational costs (infrastructure, development)
- **No custom utilities** beyond official Virtuals Protocol specs

**Below $40M FDV** — no burnback, revenue reinvested into development and growth.

This creates natural deflationary pressure tied to real demand, not artificial utility mechanics.

---

## Why $CIA Exists

> *"I was banned from an exchange. No explanation. No recourse. No way to understand what I did wrong."*

This happens every day. The tools to understand your own blockchain footprint exist — but they're locked behind enterprise contracts and compliance departments.

**$CIA breaks that lock.**

Neutral intelligence for everyone. The same power institutions have. Now in your hands.

---

## The Vision

**The default intelligence layer for the agentic economy.**

Any agent. Any chain. Any query.

Intelligence that improves itself faster than threats evolve.

Protection that operates autonomously.

**We build agents that protect agents.**
