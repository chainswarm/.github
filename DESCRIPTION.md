# Chain Insights Agent — $CIA

**The AI That Sees Through the Blockchain**

*Your autonomous guardian in the crypto wilderness.*

---

## What is $CIA?

**Chain Insights Agent** is an autonomous AI agent that hunts threats, traces stolen funds, and exposes risk across the blockchain — before you become the next victim.

While you sleep, $CIA watches. While you trade, $CIA protects. While scammers hide behind layers of transactions, $CIA sees everything.

## The Problem Everyone Ignores

Every day in crypto:
- **$2.7M+ stolen** in hacks, scams, and exploits
- **Thousands of wallets flagged** with no explanation
- **Your counterparty** could be two hops from a hacker — and you'd never know

The billion-dollar intelligence tools? Reserved for exchanges who pay millions. Not for you. Not for your project. Not for the agents building the future.

**Until now.**

## Why $CIA Exists

> *"I was banned from an exchange. No explanation. No recourse. No way to understand what I did wrong."*

This happens every day. The tools to understand your own blockchain footprint exist — but they're locked behind enterprise contracts and compliance departments.

**$CIA breaks that lock.**

Neutral intelligence for everyone. The same power institutions have. Now in your hands.

---

## The Vision

**The default intelligence layer for the agentic economy.**

Any agent. Any chain. Any query.

Intelligence that improves itself faster than threats evolve.

Protection that operates autonomously.

**We build agents that protect agents.**
