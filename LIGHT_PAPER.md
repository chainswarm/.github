# Chain Insights Agent — Light Paper

**Autonomous Blockchain Intelligence for the Agentic Economy**

Version 2.1 | 2025

## Executive Summary

Chain Insights Agent is an autonomous blockchain intelligence system built on Virtuals Protocol that provides real-time risk scoring, funds tracking, and investigative AI capabilities. Unlike centralised solutions that charge enterprises significant annual fees and offer no access to developers or retail users, Chain Insights delivers intelligence through multiple channels: a consumer application, Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) for agent-to-agent services, Butler for user discovery, and an active X/Twitter presence for real-time threat broadcasting.

The agent operates in two complementary modes: **reactive** (users ask questions, the agent researches and solves) and **proactive** (the agent autonomously scans the network, warns before threats materialise, and auto-labels risky addresses). Internally, Chain Insights employs self-improving loops that continuously enhance detection capabilities through automated evaluation and A/B testing against the Chain Synthetics benchmark framework.

Chain Insights evolved from pioneering work on the Bittensor network. Virtuals Protocol now provides the optimal environment—with ACP for agent commerce and Butler for user discovery—for our vision of an autonomous AI agent serving blockchain intelligence needs.

## The Problem

### Centralised Intelligence is Broken

The blockchain intelligence market is dominated by centralised providers—Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs—who serve enterprise clients at premium prices. This creates critical gaps:

**1. Accessibility Gap**
Retail users are blocked by exchanges/services but have no visibility into their own risk profiles or way to understand why.

**2. Agent Gap**
Autonomous AI agents need programmatic, pay-per-query access to risk intelligence. Current providers offer nothing suitable for agent-to-agent commerce.

**3. Adaptation Gap**
Static systems update on slow release cycles. Threats evolve continuously. Intelligence must improve itself faster than threats evolve.

### The Regulatory Imperative

Global regulation is accelerating. EU MiCA, US FinCEN Travel Rule, and expanding KYC requirements mean every exchange, wallet, and DeFi protocol needs compliance tooling. The market for blockchain intelligence is expanding dramatically.

## The Solution

### Neutral Intelligence Layer

Chain Insights Agent provides a **neutral intelligence layer** for any blockchain. We don't decide who is good or bad—we provide the intelligence. Users, applications, and agents choose how to act.

### Two Operating Modes

**Reactive Mode (ReAct-Style)**
Users ask questions, and the agent researches, analyses, and delivers answers:
- "Show me all addresses connected to this hack"
- "Generate an investigation report for this address"

**Proactive/Autonomous Mode**
The agent continuously scans and acts without prompting:
- **Early Warning:** Alerts before threats materialise
- **Auto-Labelling:** Detects attack patterns (e.g., dusting attacks) and labels source addresses
- **Social Broadcasting:** Posts real-time threat intelligence on X/Twitter (like aixbt)

### Access Channels

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chain Insights App** | Consumer web application with risk scoring, funds tracking, AI chat |
| **ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol)** | Pay-per-query for agent-to-agent services via Virtuals Protocol |
| **Butler** | User discovery through Virtuals' consumer gateway |
| **X/Twitter Bot** | Real-time threat alerts and community engagement |

## Architecture

### Design Philosophy

> *"The best intelligence system is one that improves itself faster than threats evolve."*

Chain Insights is a self-improving system with three layers:

### Foundation Layer

All core data infrastructure focused on **value and money flows**:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Indexing Service** | Multi-chain blockchain data capture (Substrate, EVM, UTXO) |
| **Money Flows** | USD-normalised, aggregated flow relationships |
| **ML Features** | Pre-calculated features per address |
| **Pattern Detection** | Graph algorithms for mixers, layering, peel chains |
| **Risk Scoring** | Real-time risk assessment with explainable factors |
| **Evaluation/A/B Testing** | Continuous improvement against Chain Synthetics |

### Intelligence Layer

Agent orchestration and cognitive capabilities:

- **Reactive Mode:** Processes queries from users and agents
- **Proactive Mode:** Autonomous monitoring and threat detection
- **Learning Loop:** Self-improvement through automated evaluation

### Interaction Layer

All interfaces for humans and agents:

- Chain Insights Application
- ACP Gateway (agent-to-agent)
- Butler Discovery
- X/Twitter Bot

## Virtuals Protocol Integration

### Why Virtuals?

1. **Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP):** Standardised service schema enables seamless agent-to-agent transactions with smart contract escrow
2. **Butler:** Consumer gateway for user discovery and natural language job requests
3. **Ecosystem Synergies:** Trading agents, DeFi agents, and investigation agents all benefit from risk intelligence

### ACP Services

Chain Insights exposes services through standardised schemas:

- **Risk Query:** Address risk scoring with explainable factors
- **Funds Tracking:** Multi-hop flow analysis and destination identification
- **Investigation:** Natural language queries and report generation

---

## Chain Synthetics: Self-Improvement

### The Ground Truth Problem

Measuring fraud detection requires ground truth—known fraudulent activity. Chain Synthetics solves this by:

- **Injecting Synthetic Patterns:** Known topologies blended into real data
- **Historical Replay:** Recreating famous hacks (Mt. Gox, Ronin, FTX)
- **Objective Scoring:** Precision, recall, speed—no subjective bias

### Continuous Improvement Loop

1. Agent generates algorithm/model variations
2. Tests against Chain Synthetics benchmark
3. Automatically deploys improvements that exceed current performance

This ensures Chain Insights evolves faster than threats—without manual intervention.

## Token Economics

### $CIA Token

**$CIA (Chain Insights Agent)** is the native token of the Chain Insights ecosystem.

| Utility | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Service Access** | Purchase credits for app features |
| **ACP Payments** | Pay-per-query for agent services |
| **Premium Features** | Advanced capabilities, higher rate limits |

### Revenue Model

All services are **pay-as-you-go**—no enterprise licenses:

| Revenue Stream | Mechanism |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Chain Insights App Credits** | Pay-per-use via application |
| **ACP Service Payments** | Pay-per-query via Agent Commerce Protocol |
| **Label Licensing** | Verified address attribution data |
