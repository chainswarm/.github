## Slide 2: The Problem

**Blockchain intelligence is centralised, expensive, and inaccessible**

- **Enterprises** pay $50,000+/year for Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs
- **Developers & Agents** have no programmatic access to risk intelligence
- **Retail users** are blocked by exchanges with no way to understand why
- **Innovation is slow** — closed systems iterate on proprietary timelines

> *As regulations tighten globally, the need for accessible, neutral blockchain intelligence has never been greater.*

**Speaker Notes:**
Mention the personal story — "I was recently banned from an exchange with no explanation and no way to check my own address risk." This resonates with anyone who's experienced opaque compliance decisions.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Chain Insights Subnet: Neutral Intelligence Layer for Any Chain**

A decentralised blockchain intelligence network that provides:

| For Agents (x402) | For Enterprises | For Retail Users |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Programmatic risk queries | API integration | Chain Insights App |
| Pay-per-call via x402 | Compliance tools | Credit-based access |
| Real-time scoring | Custom analytics | Chat with AI investigator |

**Core Principle:** We don't decide who's good or bad — we provide the intelligence. Users choose how to act.

---

## Slide 4: Why Now?

```

**Speaker Notes:**
Emphasise the separation: "We run the infrastructure so miners can focus purely on innovation — better algorithms, better models, better intelligence."

---

## Slide 6: The Innovation Model

**Computation is cheap. Innovation is priceless.**

| Traditional Subnets | Chain Insights Subnet |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Miners run servers | Miners submit breakthroughs |
| Rewards for uptime | Rewards for improvement |
| Continuous emissions | Tournament-based payouts |
| Infrastructure providers | Researchers & Data Scientists |

**Example:** If a miner improves pattern detection accuracy by 5%, they earn emissions for that innovation period. Once absorbed, they must innovate again to earn more.

> *We don't need miners for mere execution. We need miners for breakthroughs.*

## Slide 8: Unique Technical Advantages

**Unified Data Model: Value-Oriented, Not Transaction-Oriented**

| Traditional Approach | Chain Insights Approach |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Store every transaction | Aggregate money flows |
| Chain-specific schemas | Unified USD-value model |
| Massive storage needs | Compressed, fast queries |
| Focus on transactions | Focus on relationships |

**Benefits:**
- **Smaller:** Aggregated flows vs. raw transactions
- **Faster:** Query relationships, not events
- **Portable:** Same model works across Substrate, EVM, UTXO
- **Richer:** Pre-calculated ML features per address

---

## Slide 9: Chain Synthetics — Benchmarking Innovation

**How do you objectively measure fraud detection?**

**Chain Synthetics** solves the "ground truth" problem:

- **Synthetic Patterns:** Inject known topologies (mixers, layering) into real data
- **Historical Replay:** Recreate famous hacks (Mt. Gox, Ronin, FTX) on any chain
- **Objective Scoring:** Precision, recall, and speed — no subjective judging

**Why it matters:**
- Miners compete on measurable outcomes
- Validators can verify without bias
- Best code gets deployed to production automatically

---

## Slide 10: Chain Insights Application

**The Consumer-Facing Intelligence Layer**

### Risk Scoring
- Enter any address → Get instant risk assessment
- Understand *why* an address is flagged
- Check your own wallets before interacting with exchanges

### AI Investigator Chat
- Natural language queries about blockchain activity
- "Show me all addresses connected to this hack"
- "Explain why this address is high risk"
- Generate court-admissible investigation reports

### Pricing
- **1,000 credits = 10 USDT**
- 1 credit = 1 address risk check
- Chat usage calculated per interaction
- *Free for Bittensor community during beta*

# Chain Insights Subnet — Light Paper

**Decentralised Blockchain Intelligence for the Agentic Economy**

*Powered by Chainswarm Technology*

Version 1.0 | 2025

## Executive Summary

Chain Insights Subnet is a decentralised blockchain intelligence network built on Bittensor that provides real-time risk scoring, fraud detection, and investigative AI capabilities. Unlike centralised solutions that charge enterprises $50,000+ annually and offer no access to developers or retail users, Chain Insights delivers intelligence through three channels: a consumer application, an enterprise API, and an x402-enabled gateway for autonomous AI agents.

The subnet operates on a novel principle: **computation is cheap, innovation is priceless**. Rather than rewarding miners for running infrastructure, Chain Insights rewards researchers, data scientists, and AI engineers for improving algorithms, training superior models, and discovering validated intelligence. The subnet owner operates core infrastructure to ensure reliability, while miners compete in tournaments to advance the state of the art.

This architecture positions Chain Insights as the default intelligence layer for the emerging agentic economy—where autonomous systems require real-time, programmatic access to blockchain risk assessment before executing transactions.

## The Problem

### Centralised Intelligence is Broken

The blockchain intelligence market is dominated by a handful of centralised providers—Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs—who serve enterprise clients at premium prices. This model creates three critical gaps:

**1. Accessibility Gap**
Retail users have no visibility into their own risk profiles. An individual can be banned from an exchange with no explanation and no recourse to understand why their address was flagged.

**2. Developer Gap**  
The agentic economy is emerging rapidly. Autonomous AI agents, DeFi protocols, and smart wallets need programmatic access to risk intelligence. Current providers offer no API access suitable for real-time, pay-per-query autonomous systems.

**3. Innovation Gap**
Closed systems innovate on their own timelines. Algorithm improvements, new pattern detection, and model updates happen behind proprietary walls. The broader ecosystem cannot contribute to or benefit from these advances.

### The Regulatory Imperative

Global regulation is accelerating. The EU's MiCA framework, US FinCEN Travel Rule, and expanding KYC requirements worldwide mean that every exchange, wallet, and DeFi protocol will require compliance tooling. The market for blockchain intelligence is not shrinking—it is about to expand dramatically.

---

## The Solution

### Neutral Intelligence Layer

Chain Insights Subnet provides a **neutral intelligence layer** for any blockchain. We do not decide who is good or bad—we provide the intelligence. Users, applications, and agents choose how to act on that intelligence.

This neutrality serves multiple use cases:
- **Compliance teams** identify high-risk counterparties
- **Investigators** trace stolen funds through complex laundering chains  
- **Privacy advocates** audit their own transaction graph exposure
- **DeFi protocols** screen addresses before allowing interactions
- **AI agents** assess risk before executing autonomous transactions

### Three Access Channels

**Chain Insights Application**
A consumer-facing web application where users can:
- Check risk scores for any address (1 credit per query)
- Understand why addresses are flagged with explainable factors
- Chat with an AI investigator for complex queries
